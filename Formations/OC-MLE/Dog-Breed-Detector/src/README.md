# Python Machine Learning framework

## Description :

Python machine learning framework which contains packages & modules built for :
- Data cleaning
- Data analysis (e.g : univariate/multivariate/factorial analysis)
- Pre-processing (e.g : feature scaling, feature selection, feature engineering)
- Modeling (e.g : supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, reinforcement learning)
- Model evaluation (e.g : metrics, cross-validation, grid search)
